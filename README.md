# **[Hotel Browser]**

## Descripción

[My application is based on a hotel explorer. In it, users must create an account to log in as an administrator. The main idea only considers administrative use and not direct use by a client.

Once logged in, several sections are available in the side menu. The first section displays the user's profile, with an option to log out. The second section allows users to create or delete services as desired. In the third section, users can view reservations that have been made; they can delete them or make their own reservations from this page.

The next section is a registry of all users registered in the application, where users can delete accounts except for the currently logged-in user. A map page shows the location of each service registered in the services section, using the provided location to obtain coordinates and display them on an interactive map.

Finally, there is an 'About Me' section that includes information about me and a link to my GitHub. There is also an option to change the application's language. Currently, Spanish, English, German, and Hindi are available, but more languages may be added in the future.

The application is fully responsive for mobile devices of any resolution.]
